## Tech Stack

This build makes use of various technologies that allow it to function like the actual Google search engine.
Some of these technologies include:

1. Google Firebase
   - allows me access to fast and reliable cloud hosting
   
2. Google CSE
   - This amazing service by Google allows me the ability to configure my own search engine (this Google clone) and allows access to the search results one would encounter on the actual Google search engine. In addition, it also provides info about each individual result and this info may include, URL link, image, description, title, etc.

3. DiceBear Avatars
   - provides me an API which generates animated user icons as a placeholder for users' profile icon on the actual Google engine
   - I make use of the 'useState' and 'useEffect' hooks for this feature (notice everytime you refresh it generates new icon)
     
3. Material-UI
   - this icon library allows me to effortlessly import (and customize) the actual icons used by Google's front-end developers
